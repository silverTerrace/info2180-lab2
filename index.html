          <h2>Insult to iPhone Injury</h2>

          <p>The iPhone 15, which released recently has been reported to overheat by various users, especially when
            charging or using demanding
            applications. This has as a result
            raised concerns about the phone's safety and performance.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>The main reason this unwanted reacted for the handheld hot phone seems to be misengineering courtesy of
            Apple (surprise, surprise). In a nutshell the iPhone15 ships with a new <b>'A17 Pro'</b> Processor, and
            while it was an improvement in performance compared to last year's
            A16 chip, it appears the diference was not good enough for Apple and thus they made some changes for the
            sake of a bigger yield. The A17 Pro, manufactured by TSMC is said by Apple
            that the CPU is only 10% faster and the GPU is 20% faster than the manufacturing lines since 2020 according
            to Apple which seems not particulary impressive to them.
            Cache optimization, clock speed rates increase and the addition of an extra GPU core heavily influence the
            increase of performance quality put have very little to do with the reason why consumers have thoughts of a
            mini explosion ocurring the their hands or pockets. TSMC didn't have good enough chip yields and so Apple
            lowered effeciency standards by pushing wattage as high as they could to the dies in order to show decent
            improvements in benchmarks.
            This however lead more thermal throlttling and high peak power usage, which also explains why there are
            consumers also complaing about battery life of the new wonder from Apple.

            Another thing is that the phone's new design is less efficient at dissipating heat. <br>
            Overall, in all honesty
            I don't see why a number of Apple Consumer purchases a brand newly released iPhone every year when there is
            such a lack of innovation between the releases, but I will simply chalk it up to the fact that we are all
            wired differently.

          </p>
          <br>
          <p>Apple has acknowledged the overheating
            issue and is working on a software update to address it. The update
            is expected
            to be released in the coming weeks.</p>

          <h2>Subscription Sacriledge</h2>
          <p class="article-data">Who Ever -- Sep 30, 2023</p>
          <img src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1522869635100-9f4c5e86aa37?auto=format&fit=crop&w=200&q=80" alt=""

          <p>Streaming subscriptions and other subscriptions becoming expensive in totality for consumers.
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>Subscriptions are a big part of our lives today. We subscribe to streaming services, music services, meal
            kits, and all
            sorts of other things. But what happens when all of these subscriptions start to add up?

            The average American household now spends over $100 per month on streaming subscriptions. And that's just
            the beginning.
            When you add in the cost of other subscriptions, like cable, gym memberships, and magazine subscriptions,
            the total cost
            can be staggering.

            There are more subscription services than ever before. It seems like every week there's a new streaming
            service or music
            service launching and the cost of existent subscriptions are rising. For example, the price of a Netflix
            subscription has increased by over 50%
            in the past five years, which have other subscription services following suit.

            Society is becoming more and more reliant on subscriptions, but not to say it is totally their faults, as
            this is the only model a lot of companies use as it is the most profitable for them. For many of us
            (couldn't be me though; piracy is king. Yeah. I said it. who's gonna do something about it?), streaming
            services are our primary source
            of entertainment. And we're also increasingly turning to subscriptions for other things, like meal kits and
            gym
            memberships.
          </p>
          <p>
            <br>
            So what can we do about the rising cost of subscriptions? Here are a few tips:
            <br>
            <br>

          <ul>
            <li>Be mindful of your subscriptions. Take a close look at all of your subscriptions and see which ones
              you're actually
              using. If you're not using a subscription, cancel it.</li>
            <li>Bundle your subscriptions. Many companies offer discounts if you bundle your subscriptions together. For
              example, you
              can bundle your streaming subscriptions together or bundle your gym membership with your health insurance.
            </li>
            <li>Share your subscriptions with friends and family. If you're willing to share, you can save a lot of
              money on
              subscriptions. For example, you can share your Netflix subscription with your roommates or share your gym
              membership
              with your spouse.</li>
            <li>Use free alternatives. There are a lot of free alternatives to subscription services. For example, you
              can watch free
              movies and TV shows on Pluto TV and Tubi. And you can listen to free music on Spotify and Pandora.</li>
          </ul>
          <br>
          Of course, it's not always possible to avoid subscriptions altogether. But by following these tips, you can
          reduce the
          amount of money you spend on subscriptions each month, saving your self some cash for stuff that really
          matters.
